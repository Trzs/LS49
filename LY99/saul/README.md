Planning for the March 2022 LY99 SPREAD data collection.  Develop an entirely new workflow for SPREAD analysis building on the Sauter 2020 and Mendez 2021 papers.  Perform the following steps:
1. Simulate a 100,000-image dataset, on a Rayonix form factor, with and without a point spread function (PSF).  See [slurm script 918365](./sim_918365.sh).  I will develop the scattering factor analysis first without the PSF, and later consider the PSF.  Also, in order for shot-to-shot spectra to be associated with these simulated images, a special dxtbx.format file [must be installed](../../format). 
2. Indexing and integration with dials.stills_process, naive, with [index1_922530.sh](./index1_922530.sh) and [phil file index1.phil](./index1.phil).
3. Due to a half-pixel mismatch between simulated diffraction and metadata, the Level-0 detector position must be refined.  Steps for this are 
  a) ```dials.combine_experiments ../922530/idx-LY99_MPIbatch_000*.img_refined.expt ../922530/idx-LY99_MPIbatch_000*.img_indexed.refl reference_from_experiment.detector=0``` to combine just 30000 images, 
  b) then dials.refine [refine_level0_mcd.phil](./refine_level0_mcd.phil) combined.* output.experiments=refined_mcd.expt output.reflections=refined_mcd.refl
  c) comparison of the input and output with dials.show to determine the refined beam position.
4. Indexing and integration with dials.stills_process, using the updated detector position, with [index2_927185.sh](./index2_927185.sh) and [index2.phil](./index2.phil).
5. Unit cell analysis using a covariance model.  Output all unit cells (tdata file) with [tdata_928007.sh](./tdata_928007.sh).  Then run the covariance analysis with ```uc_metrics.dbscan file_name=928005/ly99sim_30000.tdata space_group=C12/m1 feature_vector=a,b,c eps=0.20 write_covariance=928005.tt metric=L2norm show_plot=True```, ultimately writing the covariance file covariance_ly99sim_30000.pickle.
6. A conventional merging run with Friedel mates separate, with [merge_928123.sh](./merge_928123.sh). 
7. A straight run with the [annulus worker](./annulus_929171.sh) to determine the integration shoeboxes and number of pixels available for SPREAD.
8. A series of regression tests for basic capabilities leading to global parameter refinement.
   - [test_product_0](./test_product_0_1285245.sh): The input worker is asked to keep_imagesets and read_image_headers.  Then simply test the ability of a downstream worker
    to read spectra and raw data arrays from the imageset data. The total count
    reported in the main log should agree with the number of lattices passing the unit cell filter.
    Currently FAILS on 100 nodes.  Logs only capture 90014 of 97878 images, 1659 of 3200 ranks, in < 3 minutes. No traceback.
   - [test_product_00](./test_product_00_1385292.sh): The input worker is asked to keep_imagesets but not read_image_headers.  Then test the ability of a downstream worker
    to read spectra and raw data arrays from a newly constructed imageset. The total count
    reported in the main log should agree with the number of lattices passing the unit cell filter.
    Currently FAILS on 100 nodes.  Logs only capture 90065 of 97878 images, 1674 of 3200 ranks, in < 3 minutes. No traceback.
   - [test_product_1](./test_product_1_1385692.sh): The worker defines the set of shoeboxes for subsequent spread analysis, and creates a new bool array
    in the reflections table to flag these shoeboxes.  RMSD statistics are reported, both for the spread shoeboxes and for the whole set of reflections.
    This test succeeds with 10 nodes/10K images, and 100 nodes/100K images.
9. An attempt (failed) to refine 10 images with diffBragg stage 1 (as a call to hopper_utils.refine).  In the worker spread_roi.py, comment in the call to ds1.  Then use this input script: [roi_mini.sh](./roi_mini.sh).  Two complaints are a) segfault when refinement of mosaic rotation is commented in, b) divergence from unit cell starting model.  Advise studying the [diffBragg API FAQ](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/tree/master/simtbx/diffBragg#apifaq) in detail. 
10. An attempt (in progress) to perform the same refinement with the exascale_api.  In the worker spread_roi.py, comment in the call to exa1.  Then use this input script: [exa_mini.sh](./exa_mini.sh).
