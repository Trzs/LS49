### Carryover results from CPU implementation, performed in April 2019

The benchmark runs the CCTBX/nanoBragg code to simulate
diffraction patterns from protein crystallography.  The output is 100,000 diffraction simulations from randomly oriented crystals. 
This represents 20 seconds data acquisition at a 5 kHz imaging rate, a capacity
expected at the LCLS-II-HE X-ray light source at SLAC in 2023.  The total size of the compressed images on disk is 1.00 TB (the images are
9 megapixels each).  

The calculation is embarassingly parallel: diffraction patterns are distributed over MPI 
worker ranks.  Within each diffraction image, the for loop over pixels is distributed 
over OpenMP threads.

Figure of Merit:  The total wall time for the simulation of 100,000 diffraction patterns, using 5% of the nodes on host computer.  This Table
will also be included in the upcoming paper:

### New results on Cori GPU node, August 2019

These prototype nodes each contain 8 Nvidia GPU cards.  There are 40 physical cores and 2 hyperthreads/core.  The results here
establish that we can effectively share 1 GPU card among 5 CPU cores each running an MPI worker rank. 
Load balancing works out for this particular application.
However, it is only feasible with this example to have 1 MPI rank / core; not 1 MPI rank / hyperthread

Explanation:  Each simulation is run on a single cori/gpu node.  Expanded resources are not available for the prototype machine.
However, there is every expectation that the application will weak-scale once the application is ported to Summit (image throughput
will increase proportionally to the # of nodes used).  Therefore, the "Scaled throughput" column estimates what the Summit throughput
will be if 5% of the GPU nodes are used (230 Summit nodes).

Detailed information:  within each image simulation the "inner loop" calculates diffraction contributions due to 100 separate X-ray 
energy channels.  The "inner loop time" listed in the table represents wall clock time for 1 of 100 iterations.  The "kernel time" 
is the subset of "inner loop time" that participates in host-to-device transfer, function evaluation, and device-to-host transfer.
