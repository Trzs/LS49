The LS49 simulation (step 5, for the adse13-196 milestone) now works on the master branch of
cctbx_project. Step 5 python and slurm scripts are in this directory.  Previously (one directory up)
the simulation was only written for the cctbx_project exafel_api branch; code is now ported to 
master (at least it will be shortly).
